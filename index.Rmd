## An annual summit to build the environmental data science community

Environmental Data Science (EDS) is a growing field of interdisciplinary approaches to investigating and answering environmental questions with modern data science tools. The field is broad, diverse, and expanding. This Summit aims to bring together all types of environmental data scientists to lay the foundation for a more cohesive and collaborative transdisciplinary community.

The goals of the Summit are to **build community** and **foster collaboration** within the Environmental Data Science community. This year's theme is **Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science**.

### About the Summit

Day 1 will begin with a mix of talks, panels, and engaging participant activities designed to spark conversations, collaborations and idea generation. Session themes include Entryways to Environmental Data Science, Environmental Data Justice, and Ethics & Bias in Environmental Data Science. Participants will use the morning activities to develop research ideas or questions to work on during the second day. 

Day 2 will be structured similarly to an unconference, where participants self-select ideas from Day 1 to collaborate on in small groups. By the end of the Summit, participants will have worked together to identify community needs and research ideas for Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science. 

We will then support the community  to extend its ideas, conversations and collaborations beyond the Summit.


### Participation & Application

Participation is limited to 100 attendees, with an application required. We are able to provide funding for up to 60 participants. Funding will cover travel to Santa Barbara, lodging, and the Summit registration fee. In order to attend you must first [apply here](https://forms.gle/HzEe4tYvEauNhNdV9).
