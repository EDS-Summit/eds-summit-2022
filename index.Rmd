## An annual summit to build the environmental data science community

Environmental Data Science (EDS) is a growing field of interdisciplinary approaches to answering environmental questions with modern data science tools. This field is broad, diverse, and expanding. Our goal is to bring together all types of environmental data scientists to begin laying the foundation for a more cohesive and collaborative community that reaches beyond disciplinary boundaries.

### If you use data to ask questions about our environment and how we interact with it, this summit is for you! 

## More information coming soon. [Sign up to be in the know](https://forms.gle/uLUeWkBzYQ4T9TpA8).
