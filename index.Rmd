### Building a broad tent for environmental data science.

Our inaugural summit will focus on **Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science.**


Environmental Data Science (EDS) is a growing field of interdisciplinary approaches to answering environmental questions by using modern data science tools. This field is broad, diverse, and expanding. Our goal is to bring together all types of environmental data scientists to begin laying the foundation for a more cohesive and collaborative EDS community that reaches beyond disciplinary boundaries. 

### If you use data to ask questions about our environment and how we interact with it, this summit is for you!
