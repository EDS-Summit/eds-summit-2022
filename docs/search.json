      "contents": "\nAn annual summit to build the environmental data science community\nEnvironmental Data Science (EDS) is a growing field of interdisciplinary approaches to investigating and answering environmental questions with modern data science tools. The field is broad, diverse, and expanding. This Summit aims to bring together all types of environmental data scientists to lay the foundation for a more cohesive and collaborative transdisciplinary community.\nThe goals of the Summit are to build community and foster collaboration within the Environmental Data Science community. This yearâ€™s theme is Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science.\n\n\n\nAbout the Summit\nDay 1 will begin with a mix of talks, panels, and engaging participant activities designed to spark conversations, collaborations and idea generation. Session themes include Entryways to Environmental Data Science, Environmental Data Justice, and Ethics & Bias in Environmental Data Science. Participants will use the morning activities to develop research ideas or questions to work on during the second day.\nDay 2 will be structured similarly to an unconference, where participants self-select ideas from Day 1 to collaborate on in small groups. By the end of the Summit, participants will have worked together to identify community needs and research ideas for Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science.\nWe will then support the community to extend its ideas, conversations and collaborations beyond the Summit.\nParticipation & Application\nParticipation is limited to 100 attendees, with an application required. We are able to provide funding for up to 60 participants. Funding will cover travel to Santa Barbara, lodging, and the Summit registration fee. In order to attend you must first apply here. Applications will be used both to select participation and award funding.\nParticipant attendance is not limited by sector, discipline, background, or career stage. If you use data to ask questions about our environment and how we interact with it, this Summit is for you!\nA detailed agenda will be shared with participants closer to the Summit. We are monitoring the global COVID-19 pandemic situation and will alter the format of the Summit as necessary, given state and local guidance. As of August 2021, we are planning for an in-person event with aspects of the Summit made available online.\nApplications open on August 10th and will close on September 17th.\nClick here to apply!\nRegistration Fee\nThe Summit registration fee is $225.\nStudents & Early Career Researchers can purchase a discounted registration at $175.\nRegistration fees will be waived for up to 60 participants that are selected to receive funding.\nLocation & Lodging\nWe have a room block at the Mar Monte Hyatt Hotel in Santa Barbara, directly across from the Cabrillo Arts Pavilion where the Summit will be held.
