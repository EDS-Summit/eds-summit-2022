      "description": "February 7-8, 2023 | Santa Barbara, California   \nAnnual theme: Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science\n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nAn annual summit to build the environmental data science community\nEnvironmental Data Science (EDS) is a growing field of interdisciplinary approaches to investigating and answering environmental questions with modern data science tools. The field is broad, diverse, and expanding. This Summit aims to bring together all types of environmental data scientists to lay the foundation for a more cohesive and collaborative transdisciplinary community.\nThe goals of the Summit are to build community and foster collaboration within the Environmental Data Science community. This yearâ€™s theme is Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science.\n\n\n\nAbout the Summit\nDay 1 will begin with a mix of talks, panels, and engaging participant activities designed to spark conversations, collaborations and idea generation. Session themes include Entryways to Environmental Data Science, Environmental Data Justice, and Ethics & Bias in Environmental Data Science. Participants will use the morning activities to develop research ideas or questions to work on during the second day.\nDay 2 will be structured similarly to an unconference, where participants self-select ideas from Day 1 to collaborate on in small groups. By the end of the Summit, participants will have worked together to identify community needs and research ideas for Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science.\nWe will then support the community to extend its ideas, conversations and collaborations beyond the Summit.\nSteering Committee\nBen Halpern | Elizabeth Wolkovich | Noam Ross | Wendy Guan | Amanda Whitmire | Susan Shingledecker | Dawn Wright | Dorris Scott | Stephanie Carroll | Leah Wasser\nA Research Coordination Network, hosted by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and funded by the National Science Foundation.\nSign up to receive information about the Summit\n\n\n\n",
