      "contents": "\nBuilding a broad tent for environmental data science.\nOur inaugural summit will focus on Harnessing Diversity in Environmental Data Science.\nEnvironmental Data Science (EDS) is a growing field of interdisciplinary approaches to answer environmental questions by using modern data science tools to discover and synthesize large amounts of data. This field is broad, diverse, and expanding. Our goal is to bring together all types of environmental data scientists to begin laying the foundation for a more cohesive and collaborative EDS community that reaches beyond disciplinary boundaries.\nIf you use data to ask questions about our environment and how we interact with it, this summit is for you!\nMore details to come. If you’d like to be the first to know sign up for our mailing list below\nClick here to join the mailing list\nSteering committee\nDo we want to list the steering committee?\nAdd footer with NCEAS logo\n\n\n\n",
